Round 1 - Components of ML

Machine learning methods consist of (at least) three components: 
- data
- a hypothesis space
- some loss function

Data:
       huge collections of elementary units of information which we call data points
Features of a data point:
       easily quiantified props of a data point (e.g. the average brightness of an image) 
Label of a data point:
       quantity of interest 
       higher-level fact about a data point (e.g., if an image is containing a road marking or not)

Hypothesis space of a machine learning method:
       collects different hypotheses (or models) for how the data is generated. 
       E.g.: a hypothesis could model the relation between the features (which can be measured easily) and the label (the quantity of interest) of a data point
Loss function:
       is used to evaluate the quality of a particular hypothesis and, in turn, to choose between alternative hypotheses
