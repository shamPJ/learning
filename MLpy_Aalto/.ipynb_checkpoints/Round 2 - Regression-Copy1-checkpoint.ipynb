    "In this round, we consider ML problems involving data points with real-valued labels $y$, which represent some quantity of interest. We often refer to such ML problems as **regression problems**. In this round, we will apply some basic ML methods to solve a simple regression problem. These methods aim at finding or learning a useful predictor function $h(\\mathbf{x})$. Such a function allows to predict the label $y$ of a data point based on the features $\\mathbf{x}$. A wide range of machine learning methods is obtained by combining different choices for the type of predictor functions (hypothesis space) and loss function (the quality measure used to rank predictors). These different combinations offer different tradeoffs between **computational complexity, robustness (against perturbation of data), and accuracy**.  "

    "Assume you have secured an internship at the city planning department of Helsinki. Your job is to analyze aerial photographs of the city area. Unfortunately, some of the aerial photographs have been damaged. The damaged images have a fraction of their pixels replaced by completely black pixels. To improve the image quality you can use machine learning! \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us model the problem of recovering the original image as a machine learning problem. The data points in this problem are individual pixels of an image. Each data point (pixel) is characterized by certain features. The quantity of interest (the label) of a pixel is the correct grayscale value. For uncorrupted pixels we know the label which is given by the grayscale value ($0...255$) of that pixel. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the corrupted pixels we do not know the true label (grayscale value). Therefore, we have learn a predictor which reads in the features of a corrupted pixel and predicts (guesses) the label (grayscale) value of that pixel. To learn a reasonable predictor, we can try to compare its predictions for the uncorrupted pixels for which we know the correct label (grayscale value). "

    "## Using Different Loss Function \n",
    "\n",
    "We observe from the demo above that the resulting linear predictor is heavily affected by corrupting only one single data point. The reason for this sensitivity is rooted in the properties of the squared error loss function used by the class `LinearRegression()`. Indeed by using the loss $(\\hat{y} - y)^{2}$ we force the predictor $\\hat{y}$ to not be too far away from any data point with very large value $y$ of the true label. \n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that using a different loss function to learn a linear predictor can make the learning robust against few outliers. One such robust loss function is known as \"Huber loss\" $\\mathcal{L}(\\hat{y},y)$. Given a data point with label $y$ and a predicted label $\\hat{y}=h(\\mathbf{x})$ the Huber loss is defined as \n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}(y,\\hat{y}) = \\begin{cases} (1/2) (y-\\hat{y})^{2} & \\mbox{ for } |y-\\hat{y}| \\leq  c \\\\ \n",
    "c (|y-\\hat{y}| - c/2) & \\mbox{ else. }\\end{cases}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the Huber loss contains a parameter $c$ which has to be adapted to the application at hand. To learn a linear predictor $h(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{w}^{T} \\mathbf{x}$ which minimizes the average Huber loss over the labeled data points in the training set we can use the [`HuberRegressor()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.HuberRegressor.html) class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Huber loss contains two important special cases. The first special case is obtained when $c$ is chosen very large (the precise value depending on the value range of the features and labels) such that the condition $|y-\\hat{y}| \\leq  c$ is always satisfied. In this case, the Huber loss becomes the squared error loss $(y-\\hat{y})^{2}$ (with an additional factor 1/2). The second special case is obtained for choosing $c$ very small (close to $0$) such that the condition $|y-\\hat{y}| \\leq  c$ is never satisfied. In this case, the Huber loss becomes the absolute loss $|y - \\hat{y}|$ scaled by a factor $c$."
